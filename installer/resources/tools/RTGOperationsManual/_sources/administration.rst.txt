Administration & Capacity Planning
===================================

Advanced installation configuration
------------------------------------

RTG software can be shared by a group of users by installing on a
centrally available file directory or shared drive. Assignment of
execution privileges can be determined by the administrator, independent
of the software license file. For commercial users, the software license
prepared by Real Time Genomics (``rtg-license.txt``) need only be included
in the same directory as the executable (``RTG.jar``) and the run-time
scripts (``rtg`` or ``rtg.bat``).

During installation on Unix systems, a configuration file named
``rtg.cfg`` is created in the installation directory. By editing this
configuration file, one may alter further configuration variables
appropriate to the specific deployment requirements of the organization.
On Windows systems, these variables are set in the ``rtg.bat`` file in the
installation directory. These configuration variables include:

Run-time performance optimization
---------------------------------

**CPU** — Multi-core operation finishes jobs faster by processing
multiple application threads in parallel. By default RTG uses all
available cores of a multi-processor server node. With a command line
parameter setting, RTG operation can be limited to a specified number of
cores if desired.

**Memory** — Adding more memory can improve performance where very high
read coverage is desired. RTG creates and uses indexes to speed up
genomic data processing. The more RAM you have, the more reads you can
process in memory in a run. We use 48 GB as a rule of thumb for
processing human data. However, a smaller number of reads can be
processed in as little as 2 GB.

**Disk Capacity** — Disk requirements are highly dependent on the size of the
underlying data sets, the amount of information needed to hold quality
scores, and the number of runs needed to investigate the impact of
varying levels of sensitivity. Though all data is handled and stored in
compressed form by default, a realistic minimum disk size for handling human
data is 1 TB. As a rule of thumb, for every 2 GB of input read data
expect to add 1 GB of index data and 1 GB of output files per run.
Additionally, leave another 2 GB free for temporary storage during
processing.

Alternate configurations
------------------------

**Demonstration system** — For training, testing, demonstrating,
processing and otherwise working with smaller genomes, RTG works just
fine on a newer laptop system with an Intel processor. For example,
product testing in support of this documentation was executed on a
MacBook PC (Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 2.1 GHz clock speed, 1
processor, 2 cores, 3 MB L2 Cache, 4 GB RAM, 290 GB 5400 RPM Serial-ATA
disk)

**Clustered system** — The comparison of genomic variation on a large
scale demands extensive processing capability. Assuming standard CPU
hardware as described above, scale up to meet your institutional or
major product needs by adding more rack-mounted boards and blades into
rack servers in your data center. To estimate the number of cores
required, first estimate the number of jobs to be run, noting size and
sensitivity requirements. Then apply the appropriate benchmark figures
for different size jobs run with varying sensitivity, dividing the
number of reads to be processed by the reads/second/core.

Exception management - TalkBack and log file
--------------------------------------------

Many RTG commands generate a log file with each run that is saved to the
results output directory. The contents of the file contain lists of job
parameters, system configuration, and run-time information.

In the case of internal exceptions, additional information is recorded
in the log file specific to the problem encountered. Fatal exceptions
are trapped and notification is sent to Real Time Genomics with a copy
of the log file. This mechanism is called TalkBack and uses an embedded
URL to which RTG sends the report.

The following sample log displays the software version information,
parameter list, and run-time progress.

TalkBack may be disabled by adding ``RTG_TALK_BACK=false`` to the
``rtg.cfg`` configuration file (Unix) or the ``rtg.bat`` file (Window) as
described in :ref:`Advanced installation configuration`.

Usage logging
--------------

RTG has the ability to record simple command usage information for
submission to Real Time Genomics. The first time RTG is run (typically
during installation), the user will be asked whether to enable usage
logging. This information may be required for customers with a
pay-per-use license. Other customers may choose to send this information
to give Real Time Genomics feedback on which commands and features are
commonly used or to locally log RTG command use for their own analysis.

A usage record contains the following fields:

-  Time and date
-  License serial number
-  Unique ID for the run
-  Version of RTG software
-  RTG command name, without parameters (e.g. map)
-  Status (Started / Failed / Succeeded)
-  A command-specific field (e.g. number of reads)

For example:

.. code-block:: text

  2013-02-11 11:38:38007   4f6c2eca-0bfc-4267-be70-b7baa85ebf66    RTG Core v2.7 build d74f45d (2013-02-04)   format  Start   N/A

No confidential information is included in these records. It is possible
to add extra fields, such as the user name running the command, host
name of the machine running the command, and full command-line
parameters, however as these fields may contain confidential
information, they must be explicitly enabled as described in :ref:`Advanced
installation configuration`.

When RTG is first installed, you will be asked whether to enable user
logging. Usage logging can also be manually enabled by editing the
``rtg.cfg`` file (or ``rtg.bat`` file on Windows) and setting
``RTG_USAGE=true``. If the ``RTG_USAGE_DIR`` and ``RTG_USAGE_HOST``
settings are empty, the default behavior is to directly submit usage
records to an RTG hosted server via HTTPS. This feature requires the
machine running RTG to have access to the Internet.

For cases where the machines running RTG do not have access to the
Internet, there are two alternatives for collecting usage information.

Single-user, single machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage information can be recorded directly to a text file. To enable
this option, edit the ``rtg.cfg`` file (or ``rtg.bat`` file on Windows),
and set the ``RTG_USAGE_DIR`` to the name of a directory where the user
has write permissions. For example:

.. code-block:: text

  RTG_USAGE=true
  RTG_USAGE_DIR=/opt/rtg-usage

Within this directory, the RTG usage information will be written to a
text file named after the date of the current month, in the form
``YYYY-MM.txt``. A new file will be created each month. This text file can
be manually sent to Real Time Genomics when requested.

Multi-user or multiple machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case, a local server can be started to collect usage information
from compute nodes and recorded to local files for later manual
submission. To configure this method of collecting usage information,
edit the ``rtg.cfg`` file (or ``rtg.bat`` file on Windows), and set the
``RTG_USAGE_DIR`` to the name of a directory where the local server will
store usage logs, and ``RTG_USAGE_HOST`` to a URL consisting of the name
of the local machine that will run the server and the network port on
which the server will listen. For example if the server will be run on a
machine named ``gridhost.mylan.net``, listening on port ``9090``, writing
usage information into the directory ``/opt/rtg-usage/``, set:

.. code-block:: text

  RTG_USAGE=true
  RTG_USAGE_DIR=/opt/rtg-usage
  RTG_USAGE_HOST=http://gridhost.mylan.net:9090/

On the machine ``gridhost``, run the command:

$ rtg usageserver

Which will start the local usage server listening. Now when RTG commands
are run on other nodes or as other users, they will submit usage records
to this sever for collation.

Within the usage directory, the RTG usage information will be written to
a text file named after the date of the current month, in the form
``YYYY-MM.txt``. A new file will be created each month. This text file can
be manually sent to Real Time Genomics when requested.

Advanced configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to augment usage information with any of the optional
fields, edit the ``rtg.cfg`` file (or ``rtg.bat`` file on Windows) and set
the ``RTG_USAGE_OPTIONAL`` to a comma separated list containing any of
the following:

-  ``username`` - adds the username of the user running the RTG command.
-  ``hostname`` - adds the machine name running the RTG command.
-  ``commandline`` - adds the command line, including parameters, of the
   RTG command (this field will be truncated if the length exceeds 1000
   characters).

For example:

.. code-block:: text

  RTG_USAGE_OPTIONAL=username,hostname,commandline
