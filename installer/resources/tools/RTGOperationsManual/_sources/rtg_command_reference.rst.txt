RTG Command Reference
=====================

This chapter describes RTG commands with a generic description of
parameter options and usage. This section also includes expected
operation and output results.

Command line interface (CLI)
----------------------------

RTG is installed as a single executable in any system subdirectory where
permissions authorize a particular community of users to run the
application. RTG commands are executed through the RTG command-line
interface (CLI). Each command has its own set of parameters and options
described in this section. The availability of each command may be
determined by the RTG license that has been installed. Contact
``support@realtimegenomics.com`` to discuss changing the set of commands
that are enabled by your license.

Results are organized in results directories defined by command
parameters and settings. The command line shell environment should
include a set of familiar text post-processing tools, such as ``grep``,
``awk``, or ``perl``. Otherwise, no additional applications such as
databases or directory services are required.

RTG command syntax
------------------

**Usage:**

.. code-block:: text

      rtg COMMAND [OPTIONS] <REQUIRED>

To run an RTG command at the command prompt (either DOS window or Unix
terminal), type the product name followed by the command and all
required and optional parameters. For example:

.. code-block:: text

      $ rtg format -o human_REF_SDF human_REF.fasta

Typically results are written to output files specified with the ``-o``
option. There is no default filename or filename extension added to
commands requiring specification of an output directory or format.

Many times, unfiltered output files are very large; the built-in
compression option generates block compressed output files with the
.\ ``gz`` extension automatically unless the parameter ``-Z`` or ``--no-gzip``
is issued with the command.

Many command parameters require user-supplied information of various
types, as shown in the following:

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|L|

+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type        | Description                                                   |
+=============+===============================================================+
| DIR, FILE   | File or directory name(s)                                     |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| SDF         | Sequence data that has been formatted to SDF                  |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| INT         | Integer value                                                 |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| FLOAT       | Floating point decimal value                                  |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| STRING      | A sequence of characters for comments, filenames, or labels   |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

To display all parameters and syntax associated with an RTG command,
enter the command and type ``--help``. For example: all parameters
available for the RTG ``format`` command are displayed when ``rtg format
--help`` is executed, the output of which is shown below.

.. TERMCAP=':CO#80:' rtg format --help >../rtg-docs-test/source/rtg.format.help.txt
.. literalinclude:: include-rtg-format-help.txt
  :language: text

Required parameters are indicated in the usage display; optional
parameters are listed immediately below the usage information in
organized categories.

Use the double-dash when typing the full-word command option, as in
``--output``:

.. code-block:: text

  $ rtg format --output human_REF_SDF human_REF.fasta

Commonly used command options provide an abbreviated single-character
version of a full command parameter, indicated with only a single dash,
(Thus ``--output`` is the same as specifying the command option with the
abbreviated character ``-o``):

.. code-block:: text

  $ rtg format -o human_REF human_REF.fasta

A set of utility commands are provided through the CLI: ``version``,
``license``, and ``help``. Start with these commands to familiarize yourself
with the software.

The ``rtg version`` command invokes the RTG software and triggers the
launch of RTG product commands, options, and utilities:

.. code-block:: text

  $ rtg version

It will display the version of the RTG software installed, RAM
requirements, and license expiration, for example:

.. code-block:: text

  $rtg version
  Product: RTG Core 3.5
  Core Version: 6236f4e (2014-10-31)
  RAM: 40.0GB of 47.0GB RAM can be used by rtg (84%)
