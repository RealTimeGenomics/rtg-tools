Overview
========

This chapter introduces the features, operational options, and
installation requirements of the data analysis software from `Real Time
Genomics <http://realtimegenomics.com>`_.

Introduction
------------

RTG software enables the development of fast, efficient software
pipelines for deep genomic analysis. RTG is built on innovative search
technologies and new algorithms designed for processing high volumes of
high-throughput sequencing data from different sequencing technology
platforms. The RTG sequence search and alignment functions enable read
mapping and protein searches with a unique combination of sensitivity
and speed.

RTG software description
------------------------

RTG software is delivered as a single executable with multiple commands
executed through a command line interface (CLI). Commands are delivered
in product packages, and for commercial users each command can be
independently enabled through a license key.

Usage:

Installation and deployment
---------------------------

RTG is a self-contained tool that sets minimal expectations on the
environment in which it is placed. It comes with the application
components it needs to execute completely, yet performance can be
enhanced with some simple modifications to the deployment configuration.
This section provides guidelines for installing and creating an optimal
configuration, starting from a typical recommended system.

RTG software pipeline runs in a wide range of computing environments
from dual-core processor laptops to compute clusters with racks of dual
processor quad core server nodes. However, internal human genome
analysis benchmarks suggest the use of six server nodes of the
configuration shown in below.

Table : Recommended system requirements

+-----------+------------------------------------+
| Processor | Intel Core i7-2600                 |
+-----------+------------------------------------+
| Memory    | 48 GB RAM DDR3                     |
+-----------+------------------------------------+
| Disk      | 5 TB, 7200 RPM (prefer SAS disk)   |
+-----------+------------------------------------+

RTG Software can be run as a Java JAR file, but platform specific
wrapper scripts are supplied to provide improved pipeline ergonomics.
Instructions for a quick start installation are provided here.

For further information about setting up per-machine configuration
files, please see the ``README.txt`` contained in the distribution zip
file (a copy is also included in this manual's appendix).

Quick start instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions are intended for an individual to install and operate
the RTG software without the need to establish root / administrator
privileges.

RTG software is delivered in a compressed zip file, such as:
``rtg-core-3.3.zip``. Unzip this file to begin installation.

Linux and Windows distributions include a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
version 1.8 that has undergone quality assurance testing. RTG may be
used on other operating systems for which a JVM version 1.8 or higher is
available, such as MacOS X or Solaris, by using the 'no-jre'
distribution.

RTG for Java is delivered as a Java application accessed via executable
wrapper script (``rtg`` on UNIX systems, ``rtg.bat`` on Windows) that allows
a user to customize initial memory allocation and other configuration
options. It is recommended that these wrapper scripts be used rather
than directly executing the Java JAR.

Here are platform-specific instructions for RTG deployment.

Linux/MacOS X:

-  Unzip the RTG distribution to the desired location.
-  If your installation requires a license file (``rtg-license.txt``),
   copy the license file provided by Real Time Genomics into the RTG
   distribution directory.
- In a terminal, cd to the installation directory and test for success
   by entering ``./rtg version``
-  On MacOS X, depending on your operating system version and
   configuration regarding unsigned applications, you may encounter the
   error message:

   .. code-block:: text

     -bash: rtg: /usr/bin/env: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted

   If this occurs, you must clear the OS X quarantine attribute with the
   command:

   .. code-block:: text

     $ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine rtg

-  The first time rtg is executed you will be prompted with some
   questions to customize your installation. Follow the prompts.
-  Enter ``./rtg help`` for a list of rtg commands. Help for any
   individual command is available using the ``--help`` flag, e.g.:
   ``./rtg format --help``
-  By default, RTG software scripts establish a memory space of 90% of
   the available RAM - this is automatically calculated. One may
   override this limit in the ``rtg.cfg`` settings file or on a per-run
   basis by supplying ``RTG_MEM`` as an environment variable or as the
   first program argument, e.g.: ``./rtg RTG_MEM=48g map``
-  [OPTIONAL] If you will be running RTG on multiple machines and would
   like to customize settings on a per-machine basis, copy ``rtg.cfg`` to
   ``/etc/rtg.cfg``, editing per-machine settings appropriately (requires
   root privileges).  An alternative that does not require root
   privileges is to copy ``rtg.cfg`` to ``rtg.HOSTNAME.cfg``, editing
   per-machine settings appropriately, where HOSTNAME is the short host
   name output by the command ``hostname -s``

Windows:

-  Unzip the RTG distribution to the desired location.
-  If your installation requires a license, copy the license file
   provided by Real Time Genomics (``rtg-license.txt``) into the RTG
   distribution directory.
-  Test for success by entering ``rtg version`` at the command line. The
   first time RTG is executed you will be prompted with some questions
   to customize your installation. Follow the prompts.
-  Enter ``rtg help`` for a list of rtg commands. Help for any
   individual command is available using the ``--help`` flag, e.g.:
   ``./rtg format --help``
-  By default, RTG software scripts establish a memory space of 90% of
   the available RAM - this is automatically calculated. One may
   override this limit by setting the ``RTG_MEM`` variable in the
   ``rtg.bat`` script or as an environment variable.

License Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commercial distributions of RTG products require the presence of a valid
license key file for operation.

The license key file must be located in the same directory as the RTG
executable. The license enables the execution of a particular command
set for the purchased product(s) and features.

A license key allows flexible use of the RTG package on any node or CPU
core.

To view the current license features at the command prompt, enter:

.. code-block:: text

  $ rtg license

.. seealso:: For more data center deployment and instructions for
  editing scripts, see :ref:`Administration & capacity planning`.
