/**
 * Provide output to Diagnostic of timer information.
 * This timer can be started, stopped and reset and will log output.
 *
 * Precision is to nano-seconds and output is in fractions of a second.
 *
 * Note is taken of how many times the timer is called when it is used incrementally
 * and a mean time is output as well as the total.
 *
 * Output to the log is done in a standard form with the word "Time" as the
 * first token followed by an identifier (without any embedded spaces)
 * followed by the total time, followed by a mean time (in secs) if the count
 * is greater than 1.
 *
 * The methods can be called in the following order:
 * <code> (start, stop [toString*])* </code>
 * <code> reset </code> can be called at any time.
